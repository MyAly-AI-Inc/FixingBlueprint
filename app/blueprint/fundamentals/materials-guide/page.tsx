Consider the mechanical properties needed (strength, flexibility, durability), environmental factors (heat resistance, UV stability, water resistance), aesthetic requirements (color, finish, transparency), and practical considerations (print difficulty, cost, availability). For functional parts that need to withstand stress, consider ABS, PETG, or Nylon. For decorative items where detail matters, PLA or resin might be better choices.
